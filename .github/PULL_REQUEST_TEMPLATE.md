Before your pull request is reviewed and merged, please ensure that:

* [ ] there are no linting errors -- `npm run lint`
* [ ] your code is in a uniquely-named feature branch and has been rebased on top of the latest master. If you're asked to make more changes, make sure you rebase onto master then too!
* [ ] your pull request is descriptively named and links to an issue number, i.e. `Fixes #123`

Thank you!
