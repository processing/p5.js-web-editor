Fixes #issue-number

I have verified that this pull request:

* [ ] has no linting errors (`npm run lint`)
* [ ] is from a uniquely-named feature branch and has been rebased on top of the latest `develop` branch. (If I was asked to make more changes, I have made sure to rebase onto `develop` then too)
* [ ] is descriptively named and links to an issue number, i.e. `Fixes #123`
