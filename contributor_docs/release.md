# Release

A guide for creating a release.

## Background
This project release guide is based on 
* [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
* [Semantic Versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/)
* [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version)
* [Let's stop saying Master/Slave](https://medium.com/@mikebroberts/let-s-stop-saying-master-slave-10f1d1bf34df)

## Steps
1. `$ git checkout develop`
2. `$ git pull origin develop`
3. `$ git checkout -b release-<newversion>`
4. Do all of the release branch testing necessary. This could be as simple as running `npm test:ci`, or it could take user testing over a few days. 
5. `$ npm version <newversion>` (see [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) for valid values of <newversion>).
6. `$ git checkout release`
7. `$ git merge --no-ff release-<newversion>`
8. `$ git push && git push --tags`
9. `$ git checkout develop`
10. `$ git merge --no-ff release-<newversion>`
11. `$ git push origin develop`
12. [Draft a new release on Github](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/releases/new). Choose the tag that is the release version you just created, and then title it `v<newversion>`. Then click "Generate release notes". Publish the release and you are finished!

Travis CI will automatically deploy the release to production, as well as push a production tagged Docker image to DockerHub.


## Steps for a Patch Release
Sometimes you might need to push a release for an isolated and small bug fix without what's currently been merged into the `develop` branch. The steps for pushing a Patch Release are similar to a standard Release, except you work with the `release` branch as opposed to `develop`.

1. `$ git checkout release`
2. `$ git pull origin release`
3. `$ git checkout -b release-<newversion>` (increment patch version)
4. Do all of the release branch testing necessary. This could be as simple as running `npm test:ci`, or it could take user testing over a few days.
5. `$ npm version <newversion>` (see [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) for valid values of )(npm version patch).
6. `$ git checkout release`
7. `$ git merge --no-ff release-<newversion>`
8. `$ git push && git push --tags`
9. `$ git checkout develop`
10. `$ git merge --no-ff release-<newversion>`
11. `$ git push origin develop`
12. [Draft a new release on Github](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/releases/new). Choose the tag that is the release version you just created, and then title it `v<newversion>`. Then click "Generate release notes". Publish the release and you are finished!

### What if the PR Bug Fix is branched from `develop`?

1. Make a copy of the branch locally: `gh pr checkout ##`
2. `git checkout release`
3. `git pull origin release`
4. `git checkout -b <descriptive-branch-name>`
5. `git cherry-pick <every sha in PR branch>`
6. Make a new PR that merges into `release` (has a base branch `release`)
